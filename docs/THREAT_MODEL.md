# PhantomBand Supreme Threat Model

This document outlines the adversary model and potential threats against the PhantomBand Supreme anonymity network.

## 1. Adversary Capabilities

We assume a powerful, state-level adversary with the following capabilities:

*   **Global Passive Adversary (GPA):** Can observe all traffic on the internet, including source, destination, timing, and size of packets. Cannot modify or inject traffic.
*   **Global Active Adversary (GAA):** Can observe, modify, inject, delay, and drop traffic anywhere on the internet. Can perform active probing and censorship.
*   **Compromised Nodes:** Can compromise and control a significant fraction of PhantomBand relays (e.g., 25-50% of total nodes). Compromised nodes will cooperate with the adversary.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** Can perform sophisticated traffic analysis, including timing correlation, flow analysis, and statistical attacks.
*   **AI/ML Inference:** Can employ advanced AI and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and deanonymize users.
*   **Resource Rich:** Possesses vast computational resources, storage, and financial means.
*   **Long-Term Observation:** Can observe the network over extended periods to build profiles and identify long-term correlations.

## 2. Attack Vectors

### 2.1 Deanonymization Attacks

*   **End-to-End Timing Correlation:** Correlating traffic patterns between client and destination, even with mixnet delays.
*   **Flow Analysis:** Identifying and linking traffic flows based on volume, duration, and other characteristics.
*   **Entry/Exit Node Compromise:** If both the entry and exit nodes of a circuit are compromised, the adversary can directly link client to destination.
*   **Sybil Attacks:** The adversary creates a large number of malicious nodes to increase the probability of controlling entire circuits.
*   **Traffic Confirmation Attacks:** Injecting unique patterns into traffic to confirm a user's activity.
*   **Website Fingerprinting:** Identifying visited websites based on traffic patterns, even if content is encrypted.

### 2.2 Censorship Attacks

*   **IP Blocking:** Blocking known PhantomBand relay IP addresses.
*   **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Identifying and blocking PhantomBand traffic based on protocol signatures.
*   **Active Probing:** Sending probes to suspected PhantomBand relays to confirm their identity and block them.
*   **DNS Blocking/Poisoning:** Interfering with node discovery mechanisms.

### 2.3 Network Disruption Attacks

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Flooding relays or the network with traffic to disrupt service.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Causing relays to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth).

## 3. PhantomBand Defenses

PhantomBand employs a multi-layered defense strategy to mitigate these threats:

*   **Multi-Hop Onion Routing + Mixnet:** Layered encryption and timed batch shuffling break direct correlations.
*   **Plausible Deniability & Stealth Transports:** Traffic obfuscation (QUIC, DoH, WebSocket, obfs4) makes PhantomBand traffic indistinguishable from legitimate traffic.
*   **Traffic Shaping & Padding:** Fixed-length cells, random delays, and cover traffic obscure actual data patterns.
*   **Ephemeral Identifiers & Key Rotation:** Minimizes long-term linkability.
*   **Decentralized Node Discovery:** Reduces reliance on central points of control.
*   **Anti-Sybil Measures:** Zero-knowledge proofs of stake/bandwidth to prevent Sybil attacks.
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Future-proofing against quantum computing threats.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Efficient operation on low-power devices reduces attack surface and increases network diversity.

## 4. Limitations and Assumptions

*   **End-User Security:** Assumes a reasonably secure client operating environment (e.g., Live OS, sandboxed app). Compromised end-user devices are out of scope.
*   **Physical Security:** Assumes physical security of relay nodes is not guaranteed. Defenses are focused on network-level attacks.
*   **Human Factor:** Social engineering and user errors are not directly addressed by the protocol.

This threat model will be continuously reviewed and updated as the network evolves and new threats emerge.
