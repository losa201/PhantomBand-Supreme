# PhantomBand Supreme Roadmap & Milestones

This document outlines the planned development phases and key milestones for the PhantomBand Supreme project.

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Goal:** Establish a basic, functional single-hop client-relay tunnel with a stealth transport.

### Milestones:

*   **M1.1: Core Common Crate:** Implement basic cryptographic primitives (dummy for now) and protocol message definitions.
*   **M1.2: Client-Side SOCKS5 Proxy:** Develop a basic SOCKS5 proxy interface in the client.
*   **M1.3: Single-Hop Relay:** Implement a simple relay that accepts connections and forwards traffic.
*   **M1.4: Basic Pluggable Transport (e.g., QUIC):** Integrate a single stealth transport for client-relay communication.
*   **M1.5: End-to-End Connection:** Demonstrate a successful single-hop connection from client (via SOCKS5) through a relay to an external destination.
*   **M1.6: Initial CI/CD Setup:** Configure GitHub Actions for basic build and test on push.

## Phase 2: Mixnet & Multi-Hop

**Goal:** Implement multi-hop circuits with onion routing and mixnet properties, and decentralized node discovery.

### Milestones:

*   **M2.1: Multi-Hop Circuit Logic:** Extend client and relay to support multi-hop circuit establishment and layered encryption/decryption.
*   **M2.2: Mixnet Batching & Shuffling:** Implement timed batching and shuffling mechanisms within relays to break timing correlations.
*   **M2.3: Decentralized Node Discovery (DHT/Gossip):** Develop the `controller` crate for decentralized node discovery without a central authority.
*   **M2.4: Anti-Sybil Countermeasures:** Integrate initial anti-sybil mechanisms (e.g., proof-of-work or simple reputation).
*   **M2.5: Integration Tests:** Develop comprehensive integration tests for multi-hop circuits and mixnet functionality.

## Phase 3: Advanced Stealth & Incentives

**Goal:** Enhance stealth capabilities with additional pluggable transports and introduce an optional, privacy-preserving incentive layer.

### Milestones:

*   **M3.1: Additional Pluggable Transports:** Implement DoH, WebSocket, and obfs4 transports.
*   **M3.2: Traffic Shaping & Padding:** Implement modules for fixed-length cells, random delays, and cover traffic.
*   **M3.3: TLS/HTTP Fingerprinting Mimicry:** Implement JA3/JA4 fingerprint matching and HTTP header rotation.
*   **M3.4: Bandwidth Incentive Layer (PoC):** Develop a proof-of-concept for the privacy-preserving token system for bandwidth contributors.
*   **M3.5: Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration:** Research and integrate initial post-quantum primitives (Kyber, Dilithium).

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

**Goal:** Refine the network for production deployment, focusing on usability, security audits, and community engagement.

### Milestones:

*   **M4.1: UX Improvements:** Enhance client usability, simplify configuration, and provide clear feedback.
*   **M4.2: Comprehensive Security Audit:** Engage with external security auditors for a thorough review of the codebase and protocol.
*   **M4.3: Performance Optimization:** Profile and optimize all components for speed and resource efficiency.
*   **M4.4: Documentation & Onboarding:** Create extensive user and developer documentation, tutorials, and community resources.
*   **M4.5: Cross-Platform Packaging:** Develop easy-to-use installers and packages for Linux, Android, and potentially other platforms.
*   **M4.6: Live OS Integration:** Explore integration with live operating systems (e.g., Tails-like distributions).

## Future Considerations (Beyond Initial Roadmap)

*   Integration with satellite or mesh networks.
*   Support for offline message queuing and delay-tolerant networking.
*   AI-driven path selection optimizing latency & anonymity balance.
*   Optional hardware tokens for additional PFS.
*   Web dashboard for operators to monitor relay performance anonymously.
